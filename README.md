### Hi, I'm Lulu 👋

😄 I work as a Full Stack Developer I at Dimensional Innovations where I Implement web designs for a diversity of projects and develop CMS and API within each project.

🌱 I volunteered with KC Digital Drive and completed a [TrashTracker](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/TrashTrackerWebApp) project to track community reports of illegal dumping.

🍀 I'm volunteering as Curriculum Director for Kansas City Women in Technology, developing HTML, CSS, JavaScript curricula for aspiring non-binary developers.

⚡ Fun fact: I studied philosophy for three years and co-founded a startup for a social media platform - [Symposia](https://www.projectsymposia.com/).

My quote collection:


Wise kings generally have wise counselors; and he must be a wise man himself who is capable of distinguishing one.\n
The attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and then only for a short while.

Appreciation is the highest form of prayer, for it acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts.
