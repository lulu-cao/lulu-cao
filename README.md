### Hi, I'm Lulu 👋

😄 I work as a Full Stack Developer at Dimensional Innovations where I implement web designs and develop CMS and API.

🍀 I'm volunteering as Curriculum Director for Kansas City Women in Technology, developing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other curricula for beginning female and non-binary developers.

🌱 I volunteered with KC Digital Drive and completed a [TrashTracker](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/TrashTrackerWebApp) project to track community reports of illegal dumping.

⚡ Fun fact: I studied philosophy for three years and co-founded a startup for a social media platform - [Symposia](https://www.projectsymposia.com/).
